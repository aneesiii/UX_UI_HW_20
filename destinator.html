        <p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
        <p>For my first UX design boot camp challence our cohort was tasked with designing an app for travellers to use post-pandemic</p><br>
      </div>
      <div class="dtext">
        <p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>
        <p>One of the hardest parts about planning a trip is picking a destination and finding activities you would enjoy doing</p><br>
      </div>
      <div class="dtext">
        <p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
        <p>Make travellers lives easier by assisting them with finding the perfect destination along with fun activities to do that pertain to their interests</p><br><br>

    <h4>Definition and Ideation Phase</h4>
    <div class="dtext3">
      <p>To learn more about what <strong>pain points</strong> travellers face when planning a trip, a <strong>google survey</strong> was conducted to recieive <strong>quanititative data</strong> as well as <strong>six user interviews</strong> to better understand their struggles.</p><br>
    </div>
    <div>
    <img class="d2" src="destinator/2 survey.png" width="100%" alt="d2">
    <h4>Interview Key Takeaways</h4>
    <div class="container3">
      <div class="dtext2"><br>
        <p>"Traveling can get repetitive such as sightseeing and visiting landmark, I'd like to do something different and have more variety"</p><br>
      </div>
      <div class="dtext2"><br>
        <p>"The hardest part of traveling is finding the best place to go to that will have things to entertain you. thats what majority of the planning goes into"</p><br>
      </div>
      <div class="dtext2"><br>
        <p>"Someones review will have a great factor on my decisions. if i have no idea what to expect, I am shooting blind hoping to aim at a target."</p><br>
      </div>
      <div class="dtext2"><br>
        <p>"I usually have my friends do the researching as I do not have the time or patience"</p><br>
      </div>
      <div class="dtext2"><br>
        <p>"I do not like researching at all, I want more apps that can find that for me"</p><br><br>
      </div>
    </div> 
    </div> 
    <div>
      <br>
      <h4>Affinity Diagram</h4>
      <div class="dtext3">
      <p>Using the findings from the <strong>user interviews and surveys</strong>, the next step was to create an <strong>affinity diagram</strong> to find <strong>commanalities</strong> among participants regarding <strong>what aspects in a travel app users needed most</strong>. </p><br>
      <img class="d3" src="destinator/3 affinitydiagram.png" width="100%" alt="d3"> 
    </div>
    <div><br>
      <h4>User Persona</h4>
      <div class="dtext3">
      <p>I then created a <strong>User Persona</strong> based on off the <strong>user interviews and research</strong> helped pin point the general user for this travel app as well as <strong>portray needs and frustrations</strong> I am aiming to resolve</p>
      <p>Meet Sandra Bolton, she has a <strong>passion for travelling</strong> but is <strong>indecisive</strong> when planning a trip, <strong>hates spending time researching</strong>, and <strong>wants to visit areas the average tourist would not travel to</strong></p><br><br>
      <img class="d4" src="destinator/4 persona.png" width="80%" alt="d4"><br>
     </div>
     <div><br>
      <h4>Feature Prioritization Matrix</h4>
      <div class="dtext3">
      <p>Using the MoSCoW Method, I then worked on prioritizing which features would be “must haves” based on user insights and research</p>
      <br>
      <img class="d5" src="destinator/5 featureprioritization.png" width="80%" alt="d5"><br>
     </div>
    <div><br>
      <h4>Storyboard</h4>
      <div class="dtext3">
      <p>The next step was to make a <strong>storyboard</strong> to explain a typical <strong>users journey</strong> and <strong>struggles of planning a vacation</strong> and <strong>how the destinator travel app resolves those pain points</strong>.</p>
      <br>
      <img class="d6" src="destinator/6 storyboard.png" width="100%" alt="d6"><br>
    </div>
    <div><br>
      <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
      <div class="dtext3">
      <p>I conducted an analysis for direct and indirect competitors to see what other travel apps were doing well and how I could make this app better. With this analysis, I was able to review opportunities and considerations needed to developing the app.</p>
      <br>
      <img class="d7" src="destinator/7 competitoranalysis.png" width="100%" alt="d7"><br>
    </div>
    <div><br>
      <h4>User Flow</h4>
      <div class="dtext3">
      <p>To ideate on potential user journeys, I created a user flow chart. This was an important step to think through the potential features within the app.</p>
      <br>
      <img class="d8" src="destinator/8 userflow.png" width="100%" alt="d8"><br>
    </div>
    <div><br>
      <h4>Sketching and Iterations</h4>
      <div class="dtext3">
      <p>Before creating the low-fi prototype, I sketched out the screens to think through the process of how users would interact with the app. I then testest them with users to ensure that travellers were easily able to navigate through the screens.</p>
      <br>
      <img class="d9" src="destinator/9 sketches.png" width="100%" alt="d9"><br>
    </div>
    <div><br>
      <h4>Mid-Fi Prototypes</h4>
      <div class="dtext3">
      <p>The next step was to create Mid-Fi prototypes which were then tested again with users. During the testing phase, users mentioned that they wanted to be able to put in their preferences if they did not have a destination in mind. Users also wanted to be able to read a description about each activity and other reviews before deciding to book an activity.</p>
      <br>

    <div><br>
      <h4>Hi-Fi Prototype</h4>
      <br><hr>
      <img class="d11" src="destinator/11 hi-fi.png" width="100%" alt="d11"><br>
    </div>
    <div><br>
      <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
    </div><br>
    <div class="container2">
      <div class="destinatortext">
        <p>This was my first UX/UI challenge in my boot camp using my new learnings to research and ideate an app. </p>
        <p>Looking back, some of the changes I would make is to test the color scheme for accessibility and do more</p>
        <p>user tests on the navigation and use of the app.</p>
        <p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>
        <p>1. Conduct more tests and gather more participants to use the app and provide feedback on their thoughts and struggles while using the app </p>
        <p>2. Implement a “find the perfect place to stay” feature as well</p>
        <p>3. Work on iterating the app and ask more questions to narrow down selections to find the best destinations and activities for users</p>
